        //The lines above print on one line. To print on different lines use:
        System.out.println(); // This goes to the next line. Note: this is letter l not #1.
        System.out.println("Your age is: "); //Prints the message on a New Line
        System.out.println(age); //Prints the value 16 on a New Line

        //We can make lots of different types of variables. Examples:
        double height = 1.63; //metres.  Doubles and floats are decimals
        boolean isPresent = true; //recall booleans are true or false
        char firstLetter = 'S'; //a char is a single ASCII character inside single quotes

        //Question 1
        //a) Declare a variable for a name and initialize to Joe Smith.

        //b) Print the variable on a new line.


        //Question 2
        //a) Declare a variable for birthyear, and initialize it to 2004.

        //b) Print the variable on a new line.


        //Question 3
        //a) Declare a variable for weight and initialize it to 45.6 (kg).

        //b) Print the variable on a new line.
